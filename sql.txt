SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity FROM OrderDetails AS od
	INNER JOIN Products AS p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT (e.FirstName || " " || e.LastName) AS EmployeeName, ProductID, Quantity FROM Orders AS o 
	INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS od ON o.orderID = od.orderID
  INNER JOIN Employees AS e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID;
